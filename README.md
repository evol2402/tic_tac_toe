Classic Game Implementation


Overview
Tic Tac Toe is a Python-based recreation of the classic pen-and-paper game where two players take turns marking spaces on a grid to achieve three in a row. This project showcases essential game development techniques while providing an engaging user experience through its intuitive design and interactive gameplay.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Players can compete on the same computer, or play against an AI.
Smart AI: The AI can simulate moves using basic decision-making algorithms, creating a challenging opponent.
Game Logic: Automatically detects win/loss conditions, draws, and invalid moves to ensure a smooth gameplay experience.
Customizable Modes: Easily switch between player vs. player and player vs. AI modes.
Visual Feedback: Displays the game status dynamically after every turn.
Project Objectives
The development of this project was driven by a desire to:

Strengthen my understanding of Python programming.
Explore algorithms for decision-making and winning conditions.
Create an interactive application that demonstrates problem-solving techniques.
Fun Facts
The earliest recorded instance of a Tic Tac Toe-like game dates back to ancient Egypt, around 1300 BC.
A perfect Tic Tac Toe strategy always leads to a win or a draw for the first player, if played optimally.
The game is known as "Noughts and Crosses" in the UK and "Xs and Os" in other regions.
